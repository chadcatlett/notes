PWM Init: 0x15, 0x16, 0x17, 0x7F, 0xA7, 0xAF

Bank Selection:
	Bank ID is limited to 5 bits, official interface code stores the
	old bank id when switching. Need to figure out why.

PWM Configuration:
	On my board the PWMs can't be directly controlled, instead you
	update some configuration tables with your desired settings.
	This unfortunately has some limitations as you must use temperature
	gradients to control the PWM outputs and a given PWM must reside on
	the same controller as the temperature sensor.
